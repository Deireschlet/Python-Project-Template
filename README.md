# Python Project Template

Welcome to the **Python Project Template** — your go-to starting point for small Python projects. This template is here to make your life easier (and maybe even a little more fun) by setting up the essentials so you can focus on what really matters: writing great code.

Whether you're working on a side project, experimenting with a new idea, or just want a quick start, this template has your back. It includes a package manager, logging setup, and a configuration loader, all ready to go!

## Features

- **Package Management with uv**: Say goodbye to manually managing your environment. This template uses [**uv**](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv), a super-fast Python package manager that handles dependencies and virtual environments for you. It’s like having a personal assistant for your project.
  
- **Logger Setup**: No more manually setting up loggers every time. With our pre-configured logger, you get neat logs in both the console and a rotating log file. Never miss an important error or warning again!

- **Configuration Loader**: Centralized, clean configuration management! Define your project settings in a simple `config.ini` file and access them from anywhere. It’s like having a settings dashboard for your code, but cooler.

⚠️ This project is a work in progress — things might change, break, or magically improve at any time!
